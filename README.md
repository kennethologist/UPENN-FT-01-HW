# Affirm FinTech Case Study

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company
Affirm
* When was the company incorporated?
Affirm was found/incorporated January 1, 2012

* Who are the founders of the company?
Max Levchin, Nathan Gettings, Jeffrey Kaditz, and Alex Rampell

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
The idea for the company came about as many modern startups come about...the founders Max Levchine and Nathan Gettings were hanging out and chatting about how the FICO score is a poor representation of credit worthiness. So the thought was to build a better credit score system than FICO. They realized replacing FICO would be unlikely due to its entrenchment and how long it has been around. To do this they would have to build a credit product from the ground up that makes underwriting (quantifying risk) decisions. This process took them down the rabbit hole of ultimately creating product that allows consumers to afford purchases of a number of installments/payments (buy now, pay later) without late fees.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
The company was initially funded by the founders followed by angels, VCs and now they're a public company.


## Business Activities:

A better credit score but ultimately their service became a tool to acquire customers for businesses and as a way for consumers to afford purchases over smaller payments.

The company has 2 customers the business and the customer of the business. The market size is the size of the ecommerce market in additional to brick and mortar retailers. 

What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
Affirm has better underwriting models which allows them to make better predictions on which customer and business to extend credit to and how much.

There are several metrics used to measure the success of companies in this domain:
- Number of Customers
- Number of Merchants
- Total Revenue
- Total Transactions

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
Affirm is relatively young in comparison to some of the other BNPL players in the market. Based on research they are 3rd or 4th largest player by revenue volume.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!).
I would recommend looking into creating a marketplace that combines all Affirm supported vendors in one site that provides a one stop shop for customers who want to utilize the BNPL in their transactions.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
This would benefit the company by allowing the consumer and client merchant to access more. In the case of the consumer they have more merchants thus products to purchase and in the case of the merchant they'll have access to more clients and purchase spillover.


* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
This service offering would require Affirm to develop a web/mobile platform. This can easily be accomplished with readily available technology. Ideally Affirm should use the same technology stack that they are currently using for faster development and launch time.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
The suggestion to use the existing technology stack is to allow Affirm to have a faster to-market strategy for their Affirm Merchants Marketplace.
